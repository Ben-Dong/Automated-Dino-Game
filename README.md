# Automated Dino Game with arduino 
# There is 2 versions, first version will make the dinosaur to jump while second version will make the dinosaur to duck.


# To start, we need to do some configurations. Find the threshold on LDR, angle of motor to press and release the key, and the delay of pressing and releasing the key.
# You may use the dinochrome_led.ino and dinochrome_servo.ino to do the configurations. 
# Then change the threshold, angles and delay in dinochrome_ver_1.ino and dinochrome_ver_2.ino for the first version and second version. 
# Now, enjoy the show :)
